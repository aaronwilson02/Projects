Part A: Statistical Inference

Step 1A:

Assume the average tenure is $\mu$

$H_0: \mu \geq 2$

$H_a: \mu < 2$

$\alpha = .05$

Step 1B:

Load in the required data sets

```{r}
library(readxl)
CallCenterData <- read_excel("Downloads/CallCenterData.xlsx",  sheet = "Data")
```

Compute Sample Mean

```{r}
mean(CallCenterData$`Length of Service (years)`)
```

Compute Sample Standard Deviation

```{r}
sd(CallCenterData$`Length of Service (years)`)
```

Step 1C:

Compute standardized test statistic t

Since $\sigma = 1.10, \bar{x}=1.89, \mu=2$
```{r}
(1.89-2)/(1.1/sqrt(70))
```
Step 1D:

Compute the p-value

```{r}
pnorm(-0.83666)
```
Step 1E:

Since P-value = 0.2013919 > $\alpha = .05$ then we fail to reject the $H_0$ hypothesis. There is not sufficient evidence to support the reporters claim about average tenure.

Part B:Regression Analysis

Step 1B:

Load in the required data sets

```{r}
library(readxl)
Price_SalesData <- read_excel("Downloads/Price-SalesData.xlsx")
```

Import appropriate libraries
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
attach(Price_SalesData)
```

Create scatter plot of Price Vs Demand

```{r}
ggplot(Price_SalesData, aes(x=`Demand`, y=`Price`)) + geom_point()
```
Add a trending line

```{r}
ggplot(Price_SalesData, aes(x=`Demand`, y=`Price`)) + geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method=lm, se= TRUE)
```
The relationship between price and demand is linear because as the price rises the demand falls.

Step 2B:

Create a simple linear regression line

```{r}
lm.fit=lm(`Demand`~`Price` ,data=Price_SalesData)
```

Look at summary of the lm.fit model

```{r}
summary(lm.fit)
```
Step 3B:

Since the P-value 8.08e-09 is less than .05, we can assume that price is statistically significant.

Associated Hypothesis Test for the F-Test

$$H_0: \sigma_1^2 = \sigma_2^2$$
$$H_a: \sigma_1^2 \neq \sigma_2^2$$
Since the F-Statistic (94.8) is greater than F Table Value (4.381) we reject the null hypothesis, leading us to a conclusion that our overall model is significant.


Part C: Categorical variable in regression

Step 1C:

Load in the required data sets

```{r}
library(readxl)
EmployeeSalaries <- read_excel("Downloads/EmployeeSalaries.xlsx")
```

Build a MLR for predicting salary using age and MBA

```{r}
lm.fitCAT=lm(Salary~Age+MBA,data=EmployeeSalaries)
```

Step 2C:

Summary of our MLR model

```{r}
summary(lm.fitCAT)
```

Since the P-value 2.5e-12 is less than .05, we can  assume that having a MBA is statistically significant.


Step 3C: 

response(y)_MBANo = 893.59 + 1044.15*age

Step 4C:

response(y)MBANo = 893.59 + 1044.15*(34) = $36394.69

The estimated salary for a 34-year old employee with no MBA is $36394.69
